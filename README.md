# Image-To-Text
A simple program which can be used to extract text from any given image. This doesn't include handwritten text. For handwritten text please refer to another [repository](https://github.com/ronnitp/Handwritten-Text-Recognition) which i have created.


Ensure to install the following libraries first:
1. OpenCV
2. NumPy
3. PyTesseract
4. PIL - Pillow


After installing the files, make sure to put the source program and the image which is to be converted to text in the same folder.


![The final output would look like this:]
